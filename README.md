# Pikachu-ChargePoint-Simulator
A very yellow OCPP Charge Point Simulator 

OCPP (Open Charge Point Protocol) Charge Point Simulator, allowing simulation and testing of interactions between an electric vehicle (EV) charge point and a central management system using the OCPP standard.

## Usage:

To use this OCPP Charge Point Simulator, follow these steps:

1. Clone or download the repository to your local machine.
2. Open the `index.html` file in a web browser.
3. Simulate and test interactions between the charge point and a central management system.
4. Utilize the logging features to track and analyze communication details.
5. Drink water every 30 minutes of using this software to stay properly hydrated 


### OCPP Simulation:

- **Event Handling:** The simulator handles various OCPP events such as BootNotification, StatusNotification, StartTransaction, StopTransaction, etc.
- **Message Exchange:** Simulates the exchange of messages between the charge point and central system as per the OCPP standard.
- **State Transitions:** Demonstrates state transitions and responses expected during different charge point interactions.
- **Logging Feature:** Includes logging functionality to capture and record communication details, message exchanges, and event triggers during simulations.


## Files:

- `index.html`: HTML file containing the structure of the OCPP Charge Point Simulator.
- `assets/css/main.css`: CSS file with styles for the simulator.
- Other JavaScript files:
  - `addclasskillclass.js`
  - `attachevent.js`
  - `addcss.js`
  - `tabtastic.js`
- JavaScript libraries:
  - `react.js` and `react-dom.js`: React development libraries.
  - `babel-standalone.min.js`: Babel standalone for transpiling React code.

## Notes:
- Modify the HTML, CSS, or JavaScript files to customize the simulator's behavior or appearance.
- Ensure adherence to the OCPP standard when implementing actual charge point systems.
- This simulator is for testing and educational purposes and should not be used in production environments.

Feel free to explore and modify the code to simulate different OCPP scenarios for EV charge point interactions

(No pokemon were hurt during the production of this simulator)
